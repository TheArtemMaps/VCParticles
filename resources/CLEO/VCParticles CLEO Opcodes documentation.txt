**1342: add_moving_particle_effect**

- **Description:** 
  This opcode adds a moving particle effects at the specified location for a duration of time.
  Particle effects must be in range of the player (about 95 units) when adding them into the world;
  they will not appear when added outside the range.
  Particle effects that have been added will disappear when the player moves out of range regardless of duration.

Using a particle effect outside the range listed below produces unpredictable results and may crash the game.
 The colors red, green, and blue only affect particle 14 in GTA III and particle 16 in Vice City and has no effect on anything else (I removed this restriction).
 Some particles do not obey the duration and are noted below.
 If the duration is set to 0, particles that obey duration will loop forever;
 using opcode 1343 or moving outside the range of the particle can remove a particle effect stuck in a loop. 
 The strength represents the direction and length of movement of the particle.
 Some particles look meaningless or weird absence of the strength.
 Ones that are affected by gravity can be seen arcing towards the ground if an x- or y-strength is set.
 Some particles do not obey the strength and are noted below.
 Particle effects created with this opcode is saved in block 14 of the save file in GTA III and block 15 in Vice City.
 The original script in GTA III uses particles 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, and 19; and in Vice City uses 4 and 17.

  ```

---

**1345: remove_all_particle_objects**

- **Description:** 
  Removes all particle objects.

- **Syntax:**

  1345: remove_all_particle_objects
  ```

---

**1346: stir_ground_around_object**

- **Description:** 
  This opcode creates a helicopter dust particle effect around an object, behaving almost exactly as the one created by helicopters. 
  The opcode must be placed within a loop, preferably with a wait of 0, in order to constantly create the particle effect. 
  The radius parameter is the distance between the center of the object and the particles surrounding it at ground level. 
  The density is capped at 8; any value higher than 8 is treated as 8. 
  The player character must be within about 500 units of the object in order for the particle effect to be created. 
  Pilotable helicopters in the game have a radius of 10.0 and density of about 9. 
  The original script used this opcode on Lance's cutscene helicopter in the introduction scene.

- **Syntax:** 
  ```
  1346: stir_ground_around_object [object handle] radius 1.0 density 5
  ```

- **Parameters:**
  - `[object handle]`: Handle of the object.
  - `radius`: Radius of the stirring effect.
  - `density`: Density of the effect.

**1348: start_boat_foam_animation**

- **Description:** 
	Stores the current time when the foam animation starts

- **Syntax:** 
  ```
  1348: start_boat_foam_animation
  ```
  
  ---

**1347: update_boat $CS_SHIP foam_animation**

- **Description:** 
	Updates the steaming effect around the specified object that was used during the final scene of the 'Bomb Da Base: Act II' mission from GTA III

- **Syntax:** 
  ```
  1347: update_boat $CS_SHIP foam_animation
  ```

- **Parameters:**
  - `$CS_SHIP`: Handle of the object.
